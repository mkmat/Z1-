## How to extract linear backbones from fully atomistic LAMMPS models 

Question: I am simulating atomistically detailed PMMA via LAMMPS, and have saved both a LAMMPS data file and a LAMMPS dump trajectory. Z1+ crashes as the LAMMPS files carry branched structures (chemical formula below). How to make it work?

Answer: I created a script that automatically recognizes and extracts the linear backbones from your LAMMPS data file, and saves the linear conformation as Z1-formatted file config.Z1. The Z1+ code can then be directly applied to config.Z1. If you have both a LAMMPS data file and LAMMPS dump trajectory for the same system, this script creates a Z1-formatted trajectory file. The script is available for download in the scripts folder. Call it via

    perl ./extract-backbone.pl

or 

    perl ./extract-backbone.pl <lammps-data-file>

or

    perl ./extract-backbone.pl <lammps-data-file> <lammps-dump-trajectory>

## How to convert a Z1-formatted configuration or trajectory file to LAMMPS-dump-formatted file? 

    perl ./Z1+dump [-unfolded] <Z1-formatted-file>  

creates a LAMMPS-dump file or LAMMPS-dump trajectory file. If the option -unfolded is given, the dump-file contains unfolded coordinates (xu yu zu), otherwise it contains folded (wrapped) coordinates (x,y,z). The dump-file contains two bead types: type 1 (interior beads), type 2 (terminal beads). The script is available for download in the scripts folder. 

## Are there benchmark configurations to test my own implementation of Z1+?

Yes, some of the benchmark configurations treated in the publication are available from the benchmark-configurations directory. 

## The -PPA (and -PPA+) option produces no useful result

This happens if the system is not of standard Kremer-Grest type, with a maximum bond length of 1.5. The PPA option has been added using classical PPA parameters, and can therefore only be applied if the system respects the constraint. We did not invent new PPA parameters to allow for a comparison with classical PPA results, and because results depend on the choice of parameters. If your system has a bond length that exceeds the maximum allowed value 1.5 is seen in this line:

        PPA+ init max bondl (all)     1.54848

If you still want to use the PPA or PPA+ options, you have to scale your box sizes and particle coordinates in your configuration file.
